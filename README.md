konami-code
===========

a dumb jquery thing that's lets you call a custom function whenever a user enters the "Konami Code" (up, up, down, down, left, right, left, right, b, a, shift, enter) on your website. Exceedingly dumb.

To use, simply include konami.js and the jquery 2.1.1+ in your page, then call konami.setup and pass in a reference to a function you've defined that you want to be called after the code has been entered.
